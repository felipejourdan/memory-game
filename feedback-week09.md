# Great progress on your Memory Game!

Your project is showing solid development, but there are several areas where you can make improvements to streamline your code and make it more maintainable. Here's a detailed review to guide you forward.

### What was good:
- **Encapsulation**: Some of your classes are well encapsulated. This is a strong point—keep applying this principle consistently across your entire application.

- **Effort in Code Organization**: It's clear that you're putting thought into your code structure, just a bit more refinement.

### What to improve:
1. **Packages**:
   - Organize your code into packages to improve structure and clarity. For example, you can use a structure like `com.codeforall.online.`. This is a widely followed convention and will help you and others navigate your codebase more easily.

2. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Review your access modifiers. Leaving them out entirely makes your variables or methods package-private by default, which may not align with your intended level of access. Be explicit with `public`, `protected`, or `private` to ensure your program behaves as expected and remains secure.

3. **Unused Imports**:
   - Remove unused imports from your code. These clutter your files unnecessarily and make your project harder to maintain.

4. **Exit Method**:
   - Add an exit method to your game, like:  
     ```java
     public void exitGame() {
         System.exit(0);
     }
     ```  
     This will allow users to gracefully close the game.

5. **Alert Class**:
   - Why have method overloading if the second method isn't being used? Was this part of a future feature? If not, consider removing the unused overload or clarifying its purpose.

6. **Duplicate Initialization**:
   - Watch out for variables initialized more than once, such as `cards` in the `Board` class. This can lead to unexpected behavior and inefficiency.

7. **Encapsulation and Readability**:
   - The `isMatch()` method in the `Board` class could benefit from better encapsulation. Its current state makes it hard to read and debug. Simplifying it into smaller, meaningful methods will improve its clarity.

8. **Magic Numbers**:
   - Avoid "magic numbers" in your code—numbers that appear without context or explanation. For example, replace them with constants or variables that have descriptive names, like:  
     ```java
     private static final int MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3;
     if (attempts > MAX_ATTEMPTS) { ... }
     ```  
     This practice makes your code easier to understand and maintain.

9. **Repetitive Code**:
   - In the `GameSound` class, there’s repeated code across methods. Extract the repeated lines into a single reusable method, and call that method wherever necessary.

10. **Constructor Complexity**:
    - The `Infobar` constructor is too long and complex. Break it down into smaller, more manageable methods, and call these methods from the constructor. This will make your code more scalable and easier to maintain.

11. **Previous Feedback**:
    - Don’t forget to revisit and address points mentioned in previous feedback. Consistent effort in refining your project will pay off in the long run.

### Final Thoughts:
You’re making excellent progress, especially with encapsulation and organizing your application. Keep focusing on simplifying and cleaning up your code. By addressing these areas, you’ll significantly enhance your game’s readability, maintainability, and functionality. Keep this momentum going!
